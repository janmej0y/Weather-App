📌 Next step: Create a folder named **`README`** (or directly place `README.md` at the root of your repo) and save this as `README.md`.  

👉 Do you want me to also include a **preview GIF/animation** setup guide (so when someone visits your GitHub repo, they see a demo video of your weather app in action)?
